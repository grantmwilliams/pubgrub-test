# PubGrub Resolver Development Notes

## Project Status (As of 2025-01-09)

### What's Working Well
- ✅ **Core algorithm implemented** - Basic PubGrub resolution with unit propagation
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** - 70 tests covering main scenarios
- ✅ **Property-based testing** - Hypothesis tests for invariant checking  
- ✅ **Benchmark suite** - Performance testing framework in place
- ✅ **Clean codebase** - Ruff formatted, modern typing, good architecture
- ✅ **Timeout issues fixed** - Infinite loop in missing dependency handling resolved

### Critical Architectural Decisions Made

#### Resolver Architecture
- **SAT-based approach**: Uses incompatibilities as clauses, assignments as literals
- **Unit propagation**: Core mechanism for deriving forced assignments
- **Simple backtracking**: Currently uses basic chronological backtracking (needs upgrade to CDCL)
- **Provider pattern**: Clean separation between resolution logic and data fetching

#### Data Structures
- **Immutable value objects**: Version, Package, Term are immutable for safety
- **Version ranges**: Support for complex version constraints with includes/excludes
- **Boolean terms**: Positive/negative terms for package version constraints
- **Incompatibility sets**: Indexed collections for efficient querying

#### Error Handling Strategy
- **Result objects**: `ResolutionResult` for success/failure with detailed errors
- **Graceful degradation**: Resolver attempts to provide useful error messages
- **Input validation**: Basic validation in place, needs expansion

### Known Algorithmic Limitations

#### 1. Conflict Resolution (HIGH PRIORITY)
```python
# Current: Simple backtracking in resolver.py:108-131
current_level = self.solution.decision_level
if current_level <= 0:
    return ResolutionResult(False, None, "Unsolvable conflict")
self.solution.backtrack(current_level - 1)

# Needed: Proper CDCL with learned clauses
# - Conflict analysis to derive learned clauses
# - Non-chronological backtracking
# - Clause learning to avoid repeated conflicts
```

#### 2. Term Intersection Logic (HIGH PRIORITY)  
```python
# Current: term.py:46-85 returns None for complex cases
def intersect(self, other: Term) -> Term | None:
    # ... basic cases handled
    return None  # Complex negative term intersections not implemented

# Needed: Complete Boolean algebra
# - Negative term intersections
# - Complex constraint combinations
# - Proper CNF/DNF handling
```

#### 3. Version Set Operations (HIGH PRIORITY)
```python
# Current: version.py:358-368
def complement(self) -> VersionSet:
    raise NotImplementedError("complement not implemented")

# Needed: Complete set algebra for version constraints
```

### Performance Characteristics

#### Current Bottlenecks
1. **Unit propagation**: O(n²) scanning all incompatibilities each iteration
2. **Package lookup**: Linear search through incompatibilities  
3. **Memory usage**: No optimization for large dependency graphs
4. **Future conflict checking**: Expensive compatibility analysis

#### Benchmark Results
- Simple chains: <0.1s
- Diamond dependencies: <0.2s  
- Complex conflicts: <1s
- Stress tests: Need more comprehensive benchmarking

### Testing Strategy

#### Coverage Areas
- **Unit tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration tests**: Full resolution scenarios
- **Property-based tests**: Invariant checking with Hypothesis
- **Benchmark tests**: Performance regression detection
- **Example tests**: Known PubGrub scenarios from literature

#### Test Quality Metrics  
- 70 tests total, all passing
- Property-based tests for mathematical correctness
- Benchmark suite for performance tracking
- Good coverage of happy path and error cases

### Development Workflow

### Integration Points

#### Dependency Provider Interface
```python
class DependencyProvider:
    def get_package_versions(self, package: Package) -> list[Version]:
        """Get available versions for a package"""
        
    def get_dependencies(self, package: Package, version: Version) -> list[Dependency]:
        """Get dependencies for a specific package version"""
        
    def get_compatible_versions(self, package: Package, term: Term) -> list[Version]:
        """Get versions matching a constraint"""
```

#### CLI Interface Design
- JSON input/output for programmatic use
- Interactive mode for debugging
- Flexible constraint specification
- Detailed error reporting

### Extension Points

#### Future Features to Add
1. **Async support**: For remote registry fetching
2. **Caching layer**: For dependency metadata  
3. **Plugin system**: For custom resolution strategies
4. **Parallel resolution**: For independent subproblems
5. **Incremental resolution**: For dependency updates

#### API Stability
- Core data structures (Version, Package, Term) are stable
- Resolver interface may change as CDCL is implemented
- DependencyProvider interface is stable
- CLI may evolve but maintains backward compatibility

### Debugging and Diagnostics

#### Current Debug Capabilities
- Resolution statistics and metrics
- Conflict history tracking  
- Step-by-step resolution tracing (via debug scripts)
- Comprehensive error messages

#### Debug Scripts Available
```bash
# Simple resolution debugging
python debug_simple.py

# Conflict scenario analysis  
python debug_scenario2.py

# Complex resolver debugging
python debug_resolver.py

# Conflict testing
python test_conflicts.py
```

### Security Considerations

#### Current Gaps
- No input validation on JSON loading
- No resource limits (time/memory)
- No sandboxing for dependency metadata
- Potential DoS vectors in complex graphs

#### Mitigation Strategy
- Add comprehensive input sanitization
- Implement resolution timeouts and memory limits
- Validate all external data sources
- Add rate limiting for registry access
