### ðŸ”´ Pending High Priority
- [ ] **Create empty README.md - needs proper documentation** 
  - File exists but is empty, critical for project usability
  - Add installation, usage examples, API documentation
  
- [ ] **Implement complete conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) in resolver**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/resolver.py` lines 108-131
  - Current: Simple backtracking causes exponential performance issues
  - Need: Proper CDCL with learned clauses and non-chronological backtracking
  
- [ ] **Complete term intersection logic for negative terms and complex cases**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/term.py` lines 46-85
  - Current: Complex intersections return `None` instead of proper handling
  - Need: Complete Boolean algebra for term operations
  
- [ ] **Implement VersionSet complement operation**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/version.py` lines 358-368
  - Current: `complement()` method raises `NotImplementedError`
  - Need: Complete version set algebra for algorithm correctness
  
- [ ] **Optimize unit propagation using watched literals or similar data structures**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/resolver.py` lines 92-132
  - Current: O(nÂ²) complexity scanning all incompatibilities
  - Need: Efficient data structures for large dependency graphs
  
- [ ] **Implement RegistryDependencyProvider for real package data fetching**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/dependency_provider.py` lines 162-189
  - Current: Class exists but not implemented
  - Need: HTTP-based fetching from PyPI/other registries

## Medium Priority (Important Improvements)

- [ ] **Improve version parsing to support PEP 440 compatible versions**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/version.py` lines 19-34
  - Current: Only basic semantic versioning
  - Need: Handle epoch, local versions, complex schemes

- [ ] **Add dependency cycle detection in resolver**
  - Location: Throughout resolver code
  - Current: No explicit cycle detection
  - Need: Prevent infinite loops in malformed dependency graphs

- [ ] **Add comprehensive performance monitoring and metrics**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/resolver.py` lines 411-422
  - Current: Limited statistics collection
  - Need: Detailed metrics for optimization and debugging

- [ ] **Add comprehensive input validation throughout codebase**
  - Location: Multiple files, especially API entry points
  - Current: Insufficient validation
  - Need: Prevent crashes and security issues

- [ ] **Improve CLI error handling with specific error types**
  - Location: `pubgrub_resolver/cli.py` lines 356-357
  - Current: Generic exception handling
  - Need: User-friendly specific error messages

- [ ] **Add comprehensive integration tests and edge case testing**
  - Location: Test suite
  - Current: Limited end-to-end scenarios
  - Need: Real-world failure cases and stress tests

- [ ] **Implement async support for DependencyProvider operations**
  - Location: DependencyProvider interface
  - Current: No async methods
  - Need: Better performance for remote registry operations

- [ ] **Add resource limits and security hardening**
  - Location: Resolver algorithm
  - Current: No limits on time/memory, no input sanitization
  - Need: DoS protection and security validation

## Low Priority (Quality Improvements)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] **Add CLI interface for testing the resolver**
- [x] **Add property-based testing with hypothesis for invariant checking**
- [x] **Implement pubgrub-rs style benchmarks for performance comparison**
- [x] **Add backtracking performance benchmarks with varying complexity**
- [x] **Create Sudoku constraint satisfaction benchmark**

### ðŸŸ¡ Pending Low Priority
- [ ] **Add structured logging infrastructure for debugging**
  - Location: Throughout codebase
  - Current: No structured logging
  - Need: Debug complex resolution failures

- [ ] **Standardize string representations across all classes**
  - Location: Multiple `__str__` methods
  - Current: Inconsistent formatting
  - Need: Consistent debugging output

- [ ] **Add missing type hints in remaining methods**
  - Location: Various files, especially older methods
  - Current: Some methods lack complete annotations
  - Need: Better IDE support and type checking

## Project Context Notes

### Recent Fixes Applied
- **Fixed test timeouts** (2025-01-09): Resolved infinite loop in resolver when handling non-existent packages by modifying `_apply_unit_clause` to return success/failure and properly handle conflicts when no versions are available.

### Code Quality Status
- All files pass ruff formatting and linting
- 70 tests passing in ~1.1 seconds
- Modern Python typing syntax (list/dict vs List/Dict) applied throughout
- Type hints mostly complete, some gaps remain

### Architecture Overview
```
pubgrub_resolver/
â”œâ”€â”€ version.py          # Version and VersionRange classes
â”œâ”€â”€ package.py          # Package and Dependency classes  
â”œâ”€â”€ term.py             # Term class for constraints
â”œâ”€â”€ incompatibility.py  # Incompatibility and conflict logic
â”œâ”€â”€ partial_solution.py # Solution tracking during resolution
â”œâ”€â”€ dependency_provider.py # Interface for package metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ conflict_resolver.py    # Conflict analysis and backtracking
â”œâ”€â”€ resolver.py         # Main PubGrub algorithm
â””â”€â”€ cli.py              # Command-line interface
```

### Key Design Patterns
- SAT-based approach with unit propagation
- Conflict learning and backtracking
- Provider pattern for dependency data
- Immutable value objects for versions/packages
- Comprehensive test coverage with property-based testing

### Performance Characteristics
- Simple test cases: <0.1s
- Complex scenarios with conflicts: <1s  
- Benchmarks available for regression testing
- Memory usage not optimized yet

### Next Steps Recommendation
1. **Start with README.md** - Critical for project usability
2. **Focus on algorithmic completeness** - CDCL, term operations, version sets
3. **Add production features** - Registry provider, input validation
4. **Performance optimization** - After correctness is ensured

### Files That Need Attention
- `README.md` - Empty, needs complete documentation
- `pubgrub_resolver/resolver.py` - Core algorithm needs CDCL implementation
- `pubgrub_resolver/term.py` - Intersection logic incomplete
- `pubgrub_resolver/version.py` - Missing complement operation
- `pubgrub_resolver/dependency_provider.py` - Registry provider not implemented
