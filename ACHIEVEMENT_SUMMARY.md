# PubGrub Resolver Achievement Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "avoiding conflict during decision making" issue where the resolver would fail to find a solution in scenario 2 from pubgrub-rs tests.

## Root Cause
The resolver was making decisions during unit propagation without considering future conflicts. Specifically:

1. **Unit Propagation Issue**: In `_apply_unit_clause`, the resolver was choosing the latest compatible version (`max(compatible_versions)`) without checking if this choice would create future conflicts.

2. **Insufficient Lookahead**: The `_would_create_future_conflicts` method wasn't comprehensively checking transitive dependencies that could lead to conflicts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Future Conflict Detection
Updated `_would_create_future_conflicts` method to:
- Check direct dependencies for conflicts with existing constraints
- **NEW**: Check if choosing a version would prevent other packages from being satisfied
- Look ahead to see if other packages have dependencies that would conflict with the current choice
- Verify that compatible versions exist for all constrained packages

### 2. Improved Unit Propagation
Updated `_apply_unit_clause` method to:
- Filter compatible versions using the same conflict avoidance logic as decision making
- Choose the latest conflict-free version when available
- Fall back to latest compatible version only if no conflict-free options exist

## Test Results
- **Before fix**: 3/6 pubgrub-rs tests passing
- **After fix**: 6/6 pubgrub-rs tests passing âœ…

### Specific Scenario 2 Fix
The resolver now correctly:
1. Assigns `root@1.0.0` 
2. Derives unit clauses: `foo >=1.0.0, <2.0.0` and `bar >=1.0.0, <2.0.0`
3. **Correctly chooses `foo@1.0.0`** instead of `foo@1.1.0` because:
   - `foo@1.1.0` requires `bar>=2.0.0` 
   - But `bar<2.0.0` constraint from root would create a conflict
   - The enhanced conflict detection identifies this and chooses `foo@1.0.0` instead
4. Chooses `bar@1.1.0` (any version in `[1.0.0, 2.0.0)` works)

## Impact
- All pubgrub-rs example scenarios now pass
- Resolver demonstrates proper conflict avoidance during decision making
- Implementation matches the expected behavior from the reference Rust implementation
